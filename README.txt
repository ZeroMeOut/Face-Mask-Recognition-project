This was my school project. It checks the persons' face if he/she is wearing a mask. 
You can read the documentation of the file in the pdf 


Please change the path of haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml at line 13 in "test.py" 
to where it is at your current system. Without this the "test.py" would not run properly.

Tip: It is usually located at the path of the python version.
